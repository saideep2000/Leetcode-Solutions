# LeetCode Solutions by Saideep

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my personal solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode. Each solution is documented with time and space complexities for my reference.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem. Inside each folder, you'll find the following:

- **Python script** (*.py): The script containing the solution for the problem.
- **README.md**: A brief description of the problem, the approach I took, and the solution's time and space complexities.

## Tracking Solved Problems
